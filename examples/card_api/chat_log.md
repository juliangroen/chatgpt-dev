## FastAPI Client Creation

### Prompt:

> Using python create an API client using fastAPI. The client should have two routes, a "healthy" route that returns OK with a 200 status code, and a "card" route that returns a random playing card with the suit as an emoji.

### Response:

> Here's an example of an API client using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import random

app = FastAPI()

suits = ["♠️", "♥️", "♣️", "♦️"]
ranks = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"]

@app.get("/healthy")
async def healthy():
    return {"status": "OK"}

@app.get("/card")
async def card():
    suit = random.choice(suits)
    rank = random.choice(ranks)
    return {"card": f"{rank} {suit}"}
```

> The healthy route returns a JSON response with the status "OK". The card route randomly selects a suit and rank from the lists suits and ranks, respectively, and returns a JSON response with the selected card.

## Update Client With Auth Header

### Prompt:

> Can you update the API to include a required auth token header on the card route? If the token "secret-token" is not provided a 401 response should be returned.

### Response:

> Sure, you can update the API to include an authentication token header by using FastAPI's Depends functionality. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException, Depends
import random

app = FastAPI()

suits = ["♠️", "♥️", "♣️", "♦️"]
ranks = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"]

@app.get("/healthy")
async def healthy():
    return {"status": "OK"}

async def check_token(x_token: str = Header(None)):
    if x_token != "secret-token":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Not authorized")
    return x_token

@app.get("/card")
async def card(x_token: str = Depends(check_token)):
    suit = random.choice(suits)
    rank = random.choice(ranks)
    return {"card": f"{rank} {suit}"}
```

> In this example, the check_token function is used to check if the x_token header is present and has the value "secret-token". If the token is not present or the value is incorrect, an HTTPException is raised with a status code of 401 and a detail message of "Not authorized". The card route depends on this function, so it will only be executed if the token is present and has the correct value.

## Dockerfile Creation With Build And Run Commands

### Prompt:

> Can you create a Dockerfile for the client so I can run it locally on localhost:8000? Could you enable hot file reloading and mount the project files inside the container?

### Response:

> Certainly! Here's a Dockerfile that you can use to run the FastAPI client in a Docker container:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--reload", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

> This Dockerfile uses the python:3.9-alpine image as the base image, sets the working directory to /app, copies the requirements.txt file, and installs the required packages. It then copies the rest of the project files to the working directory and exposes port 8000. The environment variable PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 is set to ensure that logs are displayed immediately. Finally, the uvicorn command is used to run the server with hot file reloading enabled, listening on 0.0.0.0 (all available network interfaces) and on port 8000.

Note that you'll need to create a requirements.txt file containing the required packages for your project. For example:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
```

> To build and run the Docker image, you can use the following commands:

```shell
docker build -t myimage .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/app myimage
```

> This will build the Docker image with the tag myimage, and run a container using that image. The -p option maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container, and the -v option mounts the current directory ($(pwd)) to the /app directory in the container, allowing you to modify the code and see the changes immediately without having to rebuild the image.


## Update Client With Docstrings For API Docs

### Prompt:

> Now update the API to have docstrings for each route that explains what the route does.

### Response:

> Sure, you can add docstrings to each route to provide documentation for the API. Here's an updated version of the code with added docstrings:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException, Depends
import random

app = FastAPI()

suits = ["♠️", "♥️", "♣️", "♦️"]
ranks = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"]

@app.get("/healthy")
async def healthy():
    """
    Healthcheck endpoint.
    Returns a JSON response with the status "OK".
    """
    return {"status": "OK"}

async def check_token(x_token: str = Header(None)):
    """
    Check the authentication token header.
    Raises an HTTPException with a status code of 401 and a detail message of "Not authorized" if the token is invalid.
    """
    if x_token != "secret-token":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Not authorized")
    return x_token

@app.get("/card")
async def card(x_token: str = Depends(check_token)):
    """
    Returns a random playing card with the suit as an emoji.
    Requires an `x_token` header with the value "secret-token".
    """
    suit = random.choice(suits)
    rank = random.choice(ranks)
    return {"card": f"{rank} {suit}"}
```

> With these docstrings, you can use the built-in documentation features of FastAPI to provide clear and concise information about each route to users of your API.
